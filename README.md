A song guessing game. 

## How it works

* You have 30 seconds to guess a song based on the preview you hear, the faster you guess the song the more points you get. 
* Is room based, each room has a theme (ex : International, R&B, Rock ...). That way it's a multiplayer game.
* You can create a private room, so you can invite your friends.

Then Launch the development server `ng serve`. Don't forget to change the api adresse in `/services`
